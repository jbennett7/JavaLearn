* Be sure to understand the keywords in Java.

* Understand the rules associated with creating legal identifiers and the rules associated
  with source code declarations, including the use of package and import statements.

* Understand the basic syntax of java and javac commands.

* Understand the main().

* Understand import and import static.

* Understand access modifiers: public, protected, default and private.

* abstract classes can contain both abstract and nonabstract methods, but that if even a single
  method is marked abstract, the class must be marked abstract.

* A concrete (nonabstract) subclass of an abstract class must provide implementations for all
  the abstract methods of the superclass, but that an abstract class does not have to implement
  the abstract methods from its superclass.

* An abstract subclass can "pass the buck" to the first concrete subclass.

* Understand interface implementations and that interfaces can extend another interface (even
  multiple interfaces), and that any class that implements an interface must implement all
  methods from all the interfaces in the inheritance tree of the interface the class is
  implementing.

* Understand the other modifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized, etc...

* There are no final objects in Java. A reference variable marked final can never be changed,
  but the object it refers to can be modified.

* final applied to methods means that subclasses cannot override them.

* var-arg parameter foo(int i, String ...);

* enum is a much safer and more flexible way to implement constants than was possible in earlier
  versions of Java.
